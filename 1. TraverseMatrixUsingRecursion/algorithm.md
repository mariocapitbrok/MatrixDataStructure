# Traverse the Matrix using Recursion

- Define the dimensions of the matrix

- Recursive function to traverse the matrix

  - If the current position is the bottom-right corner of the matrix
    Print the value at that position
    End the recursion

  - Print the value at the current position

  - If the end of the current row has not been reached
  - Move right

  - If the end of the current column has not been reached
  - Move down to the next row and start from the left

- Define the matrix
- Start the traversal from the top-left corner of the matrix
